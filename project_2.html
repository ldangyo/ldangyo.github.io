          <h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>
          <p>
            This was a project where I designed an app icon for a drone coffee
            delivery app for my graphic design class (IAT 102). The icon was
            done using adobe illustrator. The goals of this project was to learn
            how to convey meaning through images while considering the target
            audience. We were not allowed to use any words, letters or colours
            in the icon.
          </p>
          <h3>TIME FRAME</h3>
          <p>
            It took two weeks to complete this project. This included an
            iteration phase where the class received peer and instructor
            feedback on their designs.

            This was one of our early projects in this course and therefore I
            had no experience with design programs like Adobe Illustrator. It
            was quite the learning curve trying to figure out what features were
            available for me to use and how to use them. The next challenge was
            being limited to an app sized design. This meant that the design had
            to be very simple so that it could scale. It was difficult trying to
            simplify the drone as it is so intricate.

            <h3>MIND MAP</h3>
            <p>
              In order to combine the attributes of coffee and a drone, I
              brainstormed ways I could represent the two separately using a
              mind map. When doing this, I tried to break down the drone into
              smaller parts. I also thought of things that were different but
              had the same meaning. For example flying could be represented with
              wings.

            The second prototype was iterated from the first prototype to make
            it capable with the features we were planning to implement.
            Specifically, we wanted to display the current memory of the system.
            My goal was to make sure everything fits in one screen to ensure
            ease of view while using the system. As a result, the load and start
            buttons were moved to the side of the screen. The addition of the
            step controls was also added during this iteration and needed
            buttons to get user input.

          <h3 style="margin-top: 4%;">NARROWED DOWN DESIGNS</h3>
          <p style="width:80%">
            Out of these three, I proceeded to narrow it down to one using the
            feedback from my TA. I decided to go with the flying cup because the
            designs that used a whole drone was too detailed and not scalable.
            The composition of having a full drone made it not balanced since
            the drone was very big.

          <h2>RESEARCH PHASE</h2>
          <p style="width:80%">
            Since the sketches were very high level designs, I wanted to look at
            more propeller options to figure out small details like if the
            propeller should be sharp or rounded. Below are the two propellers I
            explored and the vectorization of these images.
          </p>
          <img src="images/proj2/research_img.png" width="80%" />

        <div id="finalprojdiv">
          <h2>FINAL APP ICON</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col" style="padding-top: 0.5%">
              <img src="images/proj2/iteration.png" width="135%" />
            </div>
            <div class="col" style="padding-left: 10%;">
              <img src="images/proj2/palette.png" width="81%" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row" style="padding: 2%; margin-top:3%; width: 90%; ">
            <p>
              The process from turning the sketch into a vector resulted in some
              changes. The cup was tilted in the vector to portray more of a
              motion. The propeller was also changed into a helicopter style
              propeller to make it more clear as to what it is. The propeller
              from the initial sketch could be easily mistakened as a flower or
              tie. The sharp corners of the propeller suited the sharp corners
              of the cup as well. A rounded square was added to the background
              to give the icon more dimension. The idea was that it made the cup
              feel like it is flying towards you.

              <br />
              <br />The colour of the icon went through quite a few iterations.
              At first, I went with a traditional approach and made the cup
              white. However, this meant the background had to be dark. I
              decided to go with a lighter background because people often start
              their day with coffee. But the dark background would be associated
              to a more night time environment.

        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>
          The project was successful. During my class critique session, my peers
          and instructors were able to understand the purpose of the application
          just by looking at the icon. The app icon was also scalable, which was
          something I initially struggled with in the beginning.
          <br />
          <br />
          Through this project, I was able to learn how to use images to convey
          meaning. It took a lot of sketches and iterations in order to get this
          right. I learned the power of iteration and that your first idea is
          usually not your best one. I also was able to get a firm understanding
          of how to use Adobe Illustrator just by using the program and
          occasionally googling things I was unsure about. I can now apply my
          knowledge of Illustrator to other projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          An improvement that I would change would be making the line that
          connects the propeller to the cup a lot more darker. The contrast
          between the background and this line is not different enough.
          Therefore, as you scale the icon down, this line disappears.
