          <h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>
          <p>
            This was a project I worked on with 6 people from January - April
            2019 to develop an emulator that executed CHIP-8 games on Google
            Chrome. We used HTML/CSS, JavaScript and GitHub during the project.
            I was responsible for the user interface and specifically worked on
            creating a development environment to make CHIP-8 games targeted
            towards new users.

        <h2>WHAT IS CHIP8?</h2>
        <p>
          Chip 8 is a language developed by Joseph Weisbecker in 1976 to easily
          program games. It used a series of instructions to tell the system
          what to do. These instructions are packaged into a ROM file, which can
          be ran using the emulator. Examples of classic chip8 games are Tic Tac
          Toe, Blitz and Ping Pong.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div><h2>INITIAL CHALLENGES</h2></div>
      <p>
        This was my very first group project in university and as a result, I
        lacked a lot of experience when it came to programming with a team. My
        whole team was unexperienced so the progress of the beginning iterations
        of the project was much slower than anticipated. Below are some of the
        challenges I faced:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Lack of web development experience</li>
        <li>No experience with Chip8 System</li>
        <li>
          First time working with a team so our communication and management
          structure was lacking
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div><h2>FIRST PROTOTYPE</h2></div>
      <p>
        My first prototype of the website was very bare to ensure that the
        skeleton of the website was ready for development of the system itself.
        The early sketches mapped out the layout of the website and were used as
        a communication piece for the developers to figure out what input they
        needed from users.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h2>SECOND PROTOTYPE</h2>
        <p>
          The second prototype was iterated from the first prototype to make it
          capable with the features we were planning to implement. Specifically,
          we wanted to display the current memory of the system. My goal was to
          make sure everything fits in one screen to ensure ease of view while
          using the system. As a result, the load and start buttons were moved
          to the side of the screen. The addition of the step controls was also
          added during this iteration and needed buttons to get user input.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>FINAL PRODUCT</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest change from the previous iterations was the colour of the
          website. The previous iterations looked too much like a wireframe
          because of the lack of colour. Our goal was to create an immersive
          experience when users are playing our Chip8 system but our website did
          not emit that feeling. As a result, I came up with two colour palettes
          that could potentially be used. We decided to go with black and pink
          because it was much more unique opposed to black and green. It also
          gave more of a playful feel. Green and black emitted too much of a
          hacker feeling.
        </p>
        <h3>PROPOSED COLOUR PALETTES</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>
          We were able to successfully implement all our planned features.
          Through this project, I learned team management and gained a love for
          web development. This was my very first team project but together as a
          team, we were able to work together to get over hurdles from the lack
          of experience.
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT WORKED</h3>
        <p>
          We decided to create a detailed breakdown of what needed to be
          completed early on. This gave us a strong direction on how to proceed
          in the following weeks. As a result, it allowed us to stay relatively
          on schedule and ultimately made the project a success. We did not do
          this for when we made the game snake and ended up not being able to
          finish it within our iteration. Using this breakdown, we used trello
          to organize and set reminders as to when things needed to be
          completed. Then every meeting we would refer to this and adjust it
          depending on the current status of the project. I also looked at the
          breakdown to see what was required for the developers at what
          iteration to ensure the UI is ready for them so that they can test
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT DIDN'T WORK</h3>
        <p>
          Although our project was quite smooth, the only thing that didn't work
          was the definite roles that we set in the beginning. We did not really
          follow it because when we were struggling, we would help each other
          and therefore, some people would take on small aspects of each others
          roles.
        </p>
        <h3>IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
        <p>
          Now that I have web development experience, I would’ve liked to make
          the UI a lot more efficient. The way that memory is displayed is very
          intensive to the browser and causes the whole system to slow down. I
          would’ve also liked to use bootstrap and overall more CSS to make the
          website more modern, while including retro aspects.
