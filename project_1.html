          <p>
            This was a project I worked on with 6 people from January - April
            2019 to develop an emulator that executed CHIP-8 games on Google
            Chrome. We used HTML/CSS, JavaScript and GitHub during the project.
            I was responsible for the user interface and specifically worked on
            creating a development environment to make CHIP-8 games targeted
            towards new users.

        <h2>WHAT IS CHIP8?</h2>
        <p>
          Chip 8 is a language developed by Joseph Weisbecker in 1976 to easily
          program games. It used a series of instructions to tell the system
          what to do. These instructions are packaged into a ROM file, which can
          be ran using the emulator. Examples of classic chip8 games are Tic Tac
          Toe, Blitz and Ping Pong.

          <div class="col-sm-4" style="z-index: 1;">
            <h3>FIRST PROTOTYPE</h3>
            <p>
              My first prototype of the website was very bare to ensure that the
              skeleton of the website was ready for development of the system
              itself. The early sketches mapped out the layout of the website
              and were used as a communication piece for the developers to
              figure out what input they needed from users.

          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>SECOND PROTOTYPE</h3>
            <p>
              The second prototype was iterated from the first prototype to make
              it capable with the features we were planning to implement.
              Specifically, we wanted to display the current memory of the
              system. My goal was to make sure everything fits in one screen to
              ensure ease of view while using the system. As a result, the load
              and start buttons were moved to the side of the screen. The
              addition of the step controls was also added during this iteration
              and needed buttons to get user input.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md center-block">
            <img
              src="images/secondprototype.png"
              width="80%"
              id="second_proto_img"
            />

          <div class="col-sm" style="padding-bottom: 8%; padding-top: 8%;">
            <p>
              The biggest change from the previous iterations was the colour of
              the website. The previous iterations looked too much like a
              wireframe because of the lack of colour. Our goal was to create an
              immersive experience when users are playing our Chip8 system but
              our website did not emit that feeling. As a result, I came up with
              two colour palettes that could potentially be used. We decided to
              go with black and pink because it was much more unique opposed to
              black and green. It also gave more of a playful feel. Green and
              black emitted too much of a hacker feeling.

        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>
          We were able to successfully implement all our planned features.
          Through this project, I learned team management and gained a love for
          web development. This was my very first team project but together as a
          team, we were able to work together to get over hurdles from the lack
          of experience.
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT WORKED</h3>
        <p>
          We decided to create a detailed breakdown of what needed to be
          completed early on. This gave us a strong direction on how to proceed
          in the following weeks. As a result, it allowed us to stay relatively
          on schedule and ultimately made the project a success. We did not do
          this for when we made the game snake and ended up not being able to
          finish it within our iteration. Using this breakdown, we used trello
          to organize and set reminders as to when things needed to be
          completed. Then every meeting we would refer to this and adjust it
          depending on the current status of the project. I also looked at the
          breakdown to see what was required for the developers at what
          iteration to ensure the UI is ready for them so that they can test
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT DIDN'T WORK</h3>
        <p>
          Although our project was quite smooth, the only thing that didn't work
          was the definite roles that we set in the beginning. We did not really
          follow it because when we were struggling, we would help each other
          and therefore, some people would take on small aspects of each others
          roles.
        </p>
        <h3>IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
        <p>
          Now that I have web development experience, I would’ve liked to make
          the UI a lot more efficient. The way that memory is displayed is very
          intensive to the browser and causes the whole system to slow down. I
          would’ve also liked to use bootstrap and overall more CSS to make the
          website more modern, while including retro aspects.
